<div class="div-1"><h1>Welcome to Prints By Andre' KC</h1><br><br>  I have been interested in Photography since I was in High School. I have done many types of Photography from Portraits, Weddings, Individuals and Landscapes. I enjoy finding the pleasure in old Barns, Bridges, Mountains and more. This website shows just a sample of the Photos I have taken over the years. I can add many different types of Special effects to most photos so if there is something special you are looking to display in your home or office, let us know and we can send you a sample for you to look at. All photos are of High Quality on Photographic paper so you will be getting a Photo that will last you and your family for a lifetime of enjoyment. The Photos will be sent to you for you to have framed to fit your decor. Thank you for visiting my website!</div></class>
